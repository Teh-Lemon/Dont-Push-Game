Dont-Push-Game
==============

2D Game made with Unity 4.5


Don't let the junk food push you to the bottom!

Eat apples to gain temporary invulnerability.

How long can you last?

Download is in _Builds/DontPushGame.zip. 

Extract and open the html file in your browser to play. Requires the Unity Web Player plugin to be installed.


WASD or Arrow Keys to move. Space to eat apples.


A game concept I came up with when I was younger and was mechanically simple enough to implement while I was learning how to use Unity.


It's not particularly challenging but I wanted to move onto other projects after I had gotten a hang of the editor.
